    <h1>Tamale Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/tamales.jpg" alt="This is a photo of some tamales">

    <p>Tamales are a cherished staple in Latin American cuisine, 
        celebrated for their comforting, homemade taste and cultural significance. 
        Made from soft, steamed corn dough known as masa, tamales are filled with 
        a variety of savory ingredients such as spiced meats, cheeses, or vegetables. 
        The fillings are expertly seasoned, offering a rich and flavorful 
        contrast to the mild, slightly sweet masa. Wrapped in corn husks or banana 
        leaves, which impart a subtle earthiness during the cooking process, tamales 
        are steamed to perfection.</p>
    
    <p>The result is a dish thatâ€™s both tender and hearty, with each bite revealing 
        a perfect balance of textures and flavors. Often served during holidays and 
        special gatherings, tamales bring people together, offering a taste of 
        tradition and a connection to heritage.</p>
